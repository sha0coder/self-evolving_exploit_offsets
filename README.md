# self-evolving_exploit_offsets

Not always exploits are universal and contain offsets to be pin-pointed for a specific machine.
Often bruteforce is used to guess the offsets due to the complexity of doing it manually.
But many times bruteforce is not feasible because there are many combinations.

I have used an machine learning / optimization algorithm to improve a heap-fengshui from chaos to the most optimal allocation for the exploitation on a specific system.

It's not tecnically complicated, I have used a genetic algorithm to evolve the offsets, If you can measure how good are the offsets and put a score you can evolve them.
