free.gdb  		gdb script that dump address of user_args and ni->name  
trace_heap.sh		launches gdb with free.gdb and calculate the distance substracting addresses
genetic2.py		genetic algorithm that calculates the 5 of the 6 offsets of the exploit.


Notes:
	- debugging sudo needs root
	- the GA requires root
	- bruteforce the padding (off2) requires non root, the bruteforcing code is commented.
	- trace_heap is used from the GA, but can be launched manually and logs into "log" file.
